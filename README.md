My first web app in Java/Spring with sprinkled of a little bit of SQL. 
It's register/login system with ability to post internet auctions.
For now the data is send in json to the server to be procesed.
You can register new user, add new auction with pictures(the pictures are not finished yet, you can only add path to a picture file),
edit auction and assign catery.
As admin you can create new categories and edit them.
